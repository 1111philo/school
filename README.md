# 1111 School

A generative learning platform. Describe what you want to learn, get a personalized course with lessons, practice activities, and a final assessment.

## What's Built

The full learning loop works end-to-end:

- **Course catalog** — Browse predefined courses or create your own with custom objectives
- **AI generation** — Each objective gets a lesson, practice activity, and scoring rubric, generated by Claude via PydanticAI agents
- **Generation progress UI** — Real-time stepper showing generation progress per objective (REST + SSE)
- **Lesson reader** — Markdown-rendered lessons with syntax highlighting, sequential navigation
- **Activity submission** — Write a response, get AI-scored feedback with strengths/improvements/tips, retry if desired
- **Lesson progression** — Completing an activity unlocks the next lesson
- **Final assessment** — After all lessons, a summative assessment covers every objective
- **Course management** — List, resume, delete courses

### What to Review

1. **Basic UX/UI** — Is the flow intuitive? Where do you get stuck or confused?
2. **Content quality** — Are the generated lessons useful? Do they actually teach? Or does it feel like slop?
3. **Learning experience** — Does the arc of lesson → activity → feedback → next lesson feel right?
4. **Activity grading** — Is the AI feedback helpful? Are scores fair? Does the rubric make sense?

### What's Still TODO

- **Learner profiles & customization** — The profile form exists but doesn't meaningfully shape generated content yet
- **Productionization** — Auth is stubbed (single dev user), no deployment config, no rate limiting

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** — for PostgreSQL
- **Python 3.12+** and **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — backend package manager
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** — frontend
- **Anthropic API key** — get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
cd learn

# 2. Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d

# 3. Backend setup
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
uv sync
PYTHONPATH=src uv run alembic upgrade head
cd ..

# 4. Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..

# 5. Install root dev dependencies (concurrently)
npm install
```

## Running

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the backend (FastAPI on `:8000`) and frontend (Vite on `:5173`) concurrently.

Open **http://localhost:5173** to start.

### First run

1. Browse the catalog or click **Create Your Own**
2. Enter a topic description and 2-5 learning objectives
3. Hit **Generate** and watch the stepper — each objective takes ~30-60 seconds
4. Once complete, click **Start Learning** to read the first lesson
5. After reading, complete the practice activity and submit
6. Work through all lessons, then take the final assessment
